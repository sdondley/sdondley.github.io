      <p>The current pace of human-caused carbon emissions is increasingly likely to
trigger irreversible damage to the planet, according to a comprehensive
international study released Wednesday. Researchers studying one of the
most important and vexing topics in climate science — how sensitive the
Earth’s climate is to a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere — found that warming is extremely unlikely to be on the low
end of estimates.</p>

<p>These scientists now say it is likely that if human activities — such as
burning oil, gas and coal along with deforestation — push carbon dioxide
to such levels, the Earth’s global average temperature will most likely
increase between 4.1 and 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2.3 and 4.5 degrees
Celsius). The previous and long-standing estimated range of climate
sensitivity, as first laid out in a 1979 report, was 2.7 to 8.1 degrees
Fahrenheit (1.5 to 4.5 Celsius).</p>

<p>If the warming reaches the midpoint of this new range, it would be
extremely damaging, said Kate Marvel, a physicist at NASA’s Goddard
Institute of Space Studies and Columbia University, who called it the
equivalent of a “five-alarm fire” for the planet.</p>

<p>The new range is narrower than previous studies but shows at least a 95
percent chance that a doubling of carbon dioxide, which the world is on
course to reach within the next five decades or so, would result in warming
greater than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) relative to
preindustrial temperatures. That is the threshold beyond which scientists
say the Earth will suffer dangerous effects — disruptive sea level rise,
intolerable heat waves and other extreme weather and permanent damage to
ecosystems.</p>

<p>[2°C: BEYOND THE LIMIT - Extreme climate change has arrived in America]</p>

<p>Staying below that is still possible. If steep emissions cuts are made in
the near-term, a doubling of carbon dioxide levels could be avoided. But if
a doubling does occur, there would be a 6 to 18 percent chance of exceeding
the upper bound defined by the study of 8.1 Fahrenheit (4.5 Celsius).</p>

<p>The study by 25 researchers from around the world, published in the journal
Reviews of Geophysics, is the result of a four-year effort sponsored by the
World Climate Research Program. It includes a narrower projected
sensitivity range of 4.7 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit (2.6 to 3.9 Celsius) that
has a 66 percent chance of occurring.</p>

<p>For decades, climate scientists have been seeking to answer the question of
how much global temperatures would climb if the amount of carbon dioxide in
the Earth’s atmosphere were to double. This measure was estimated in a
1979 study from the National Research Council led by Massachusetts
Institute of Technology professor Jule Charney.</p>

<p>The “Charney Report” concluded that the planet’s climate sensitivity
was most likely within the range of 2.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to
4.5 Celsius).</p>

<p>Ever since, researchers have tried to narrow that range, contending with
myriad uncertainties in how the oceans and atmosphere respond to historical
changes in solar output, the planet’s orbit, past periods with higher
amounts of carbon dioxide in the air as well as feedback, such as how
various cloud types act to trap or reflect heat energy. In addition,
scientists have wrestled with uncertainties in models that simulate past,
present and future climate change.</p>

<p>“Constraining climate sensitivity has been something of a holy grail in
climate science for some time,” said study co-author Zeke Hausfather,
director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute.</p>

<p>The climate sensitivity question has taken on new urgency as some of the
newest computer models developed for the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), due in a report next year, show a higher climate
sensitivity than earlier models.</p>

<p>The new result narrows the range from what Charney and his colleagues
calculated while raising the lower bound.</p>

<p>[Millions of homeowners face flood risks without realizing it, and climate
change is making it worse]</p>

<p>To produce the study, the group of researchers worked like detectives,
breaking up into teams that sifted through multiple sources of evidence.
Some of the data examined include instrument records since the industrial
revolution, paleoclimate records from coral reefs and ice cores that
provide evidence of prehistoric temperatures, and satellite observations
and intricate models of how the climate system works.</p>

<p>To reach their new, authoritative estimates, the researchers required that
multiple lines of evidence point to the same general conclusion and that
this be explained without being the result of a bias that influences one or
more sources of evidence.</p>

<p>“An important part of the process was to ensure that the lines of
evidence were more or less independent,” lead author Steven Sherwood, a
climate scientist at the University of New South Wales’s ARC Center of
Excellence for Climate Extremes, said in a news release. “You can think
of it as the mathematical version of trying to determine if a rumor you
hear separately from two people could have sprung from the same source; or
if one of two eyewitnesses to a crime has been influenced by hearing the
story of the other one,” Sherwood said.</p>

<p>Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University who was not
involved in the study, called this “a tour de force of climate
science.” He said via email that the study “really, really kills the
skeptical argument that climate sensitivity is low.”</p>

<p>“It would have been great if the skeptics had been correct and climate
sensitivity was, say, 1.5°C, but that’s not the world we live in.”</p>

<p>[Siberian heat streak and Arctic temperature record virtually
‘impossible’ without global warming, study says]</p>

<p>The term “climate sensitivity” might seem like an academic construct, a
metric that matters more in the grand theories and computer models of
scientists than it does in our everyday lives.</p>

<p>In fact, the study has a message that matters to us a great deal: There is
basically little or no chance that we are going to get lucky and find that
the warming caused by our activities turns out to be minor.</p>

<p>There are at least two main lines of evidence that lead to the conclusion,
based on the study. The first is simply the warming that has already
occurred since the industrial revolution.</p>

<p>Currently, with atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide at 415 parts
per million (compared with a preindustrial level of 280 parts per million),
the world is about halfway toward doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide (560
parts per million). And already, the Earth has warmed by at least 1 degree
Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial temperatures.</p>

<p>The new research finds that, in light of this, there is strong evidence
refuting the notion that a doubling of carbon dioxide would only cause
about 2.6 degrees (1.5 Celsius) of warming.</p>

<p>At the same time, researchers rejected the idea that there is any factor in
the climate system that will counteract the warming trend in a meaningful
way.</p>

<p>In the past, climate change contrarians and doubters have said that clouds
might be such a factor. For instance, if as the planet warms the overall
size, composition or surface area of clouds increases, they could reflect
more sunlight from Earth, which would cool the planet some. But the study
finds that isn’t likely to happen.</p>

<p>“We find that a negative total cloud feedback is very unlikely,” the
authors write, concluding that for this reason the climate sensitivity
cannot be very low.</p>

<p>“The uncertainty is really asymmetric here,” Marvel said in an
interview. “We can be very confident in ruling out sensitivities on the
low end. So basically what we’re saying here is that there is really no
evidence for any sort of natural response, any sort of big, stabilizing
feedback, that in the absence of human actions, is going to save us from
climate change.”</p>

<p>But Gavin Schmidt, the study’s co-author and Marvel’s colleague at NASA
Goddard, offered some optimism, noting that collective action by nations
could prevent the doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>“The primary determinant of future climate is human actions,” Marvel
said.</p>
