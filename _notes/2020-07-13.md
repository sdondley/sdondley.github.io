# 13th
* learning how to use the vimwiki diary effectively with new [Jekyll site](/Jekyll-site)
  * Currently wondering why they call it "Jekyll"
* Need to figure out a good way to delete unwanted notes
  * currently have to manually delete `md` files from wiki and corresponding
    `md`
    files in my Jekyll site's _notes folder
  * easiest solution is probably to put it in the glue perl script,
    [markdown_to_note](/markdown_to_note)
* Also need to modify markdown_to_note file determine if a note is a diary entry
* Made a bunch of notes. So far I'm loving this new setup and integration with
  vimwiki. I think I have a solution for maintaining a site that I finally enjoy
  working with.
* Watched a ZETTELKASTEN video:

  * also see "second brain":
    [https://maggieappleton.com/neocyborgs](https://maggieappleton.com/neocyborgs)
* turned on spell check for vimwiki
  * added `setlocal spell` to vimwiki file
* took cousin to Boston for appt.
  * went to Max's Tavern afterward
* came home, took a very long nap üòÅ
* picked up first Twitter follower on my new account
* vim is once again very slow to scroll in a perl file of modest size.
  * Seems like nested braces are what do it?
  * disabling syntax highlighting doesn't help
  * :set ttyfast doesn't help
  * :set lazyredraw doesn't help
  * in a separate window outside of tmux it is very fast
    * something to do with tmux?
  * Opening in new tmux window does not help
  * Seem restarting tmux does the trick
    * also turned off opacity

## Notable news
* It's unbelievable that Trump admin is attacking Fauci. Criminal.
* Tucker Carlson goes on a "trout fishing" vacation after head writer is exposed
  as vile racist
* COVID still raging in southern states
* All kinds of other Trump nuttiness, as usual
