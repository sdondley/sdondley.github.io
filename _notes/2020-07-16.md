## Todo
### Digital gardening
* ~~Shorten long, "naked" urls~~
  * ~~use markdown_to_note script~~
* ~~Automatically browse to note getting edited in vimwiki~~
  * ~~would be amazing if vim opened file based on which url was open in browser~~
  * ~~ideally whenever a note opened~~
  * ~~happy with when saved~~

## Stuff done
* added "new" bullet to note listing
  * shows if content is less than 48 hours old
* added markers for note listing on site
  * displayed for new, updated and finished notes
* fixed a bug in vim configuration preventing generation of all notes
* wrote a map, `<leader>gv` to browse to page open in vim
* discovered that automatic browsing is too slow
  * so I came up with a good compromise solution:
    * `<leader><cr>` will refresh the browser after link is opened
* wrote a map and function to load vim file that is open in browser
* found a way to delete Jekyll note when corresponding vimwiki note no longer
  exists
  * done by hacking vimwiki customizations branch
* fixed bug in custom bash functions for git
  * was not handling spaces well

## Quick notes
* Started reading Mary Trump's book, "Too Much and Never Enough"
* 50 day streak on Apple watch ring closing going.
  * Move goal currently set to 850 calories per day

## Rousing reads
* [Laura Ingraham’s Descent Into Despair - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/laura-ingrahams-descent-into-despair/614245/?utm_source=digg)
  * If it weren’t for her faith, she said, “I wouldn’t be here . . . I probably wouldn’t be alive.” That was why, she said, she fought to save America from the godless: “If we lose faith in God, as a country—we lose our country.”
    * She's a nut

## Notable news
* Trump gave another rambling, nutty speech on White House lawn. God help us.
  * How the hell does he get away with giving a campaign speech at the White
    House?
    * Similarly, how does he get away with promoting Goya products from the desk
      of the resolute?
    * I'm sickened by what's happened to the United States.
