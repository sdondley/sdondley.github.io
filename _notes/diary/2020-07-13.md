* learning how to use the vimwiki diary effectively with new [Jekyll site](/Jekyll-site)
  * Currently wondering why they call it "Jekyll"
* Need to figure out a good way to delete unwanted notes
  * currently have to manually delete md files from wiki and corresponding md
    files in my jekyll site's _notes folder
  * easiest solution is probably to put it in the glue perl script,
    [markdown_to_note](/markdown_to_note)
* Also need to modify markdown_to_note file determine if a note is a diary entry
* Made a bunch of notes. So far I'm loving this new setup and integration with
  vimwiki. I think I have a solution for maintaining a site that I finally enjoy
  working with.
* It's unbelievable that Trump admin is attacking Fauci. Criminal.
