## Trump’s Favorite TV Network Is Post-parody ##

### One America News is the straight truth for Trump fans, and completely surreal for everyone else. ###

One America News, or OAN, or OANN—whichever you like, it’s all the same
thing—is Donald Trump’s favorite cable-news channel. Mostly this is
because One America News seems to agree with Trump about everything, in
the same way a dog agrees to chase its own tail. Every day, Trump does
something that catches OAN’s attention, and it’s off to the races. He’s
part ringleader, part muse. If you’re wondering just how deep the
fealty goes, consider this actual headline that ran on oann.com at the
end of March, when Trump was still in his denial phase about the
coronavirus: “President Handling Emergency Well in First Term.” So
well, in fact, we should just give him that second term right now,
wouldn’t you say? Every so often, Trump and Fox News have a lover’s
spat, and this is when he really turns on the charm toward
OAN—retweeting its praise of him, calling on its correspondents at
press briefings two days in a row. Or, to put the relationship in
tabloid terms familiar to Trump: He treats OAN like his sidepiece, and
Fox News like a future ex-wife.

One America News predates the Trump presidency—it launched in 2013—so
its rise is less a response to Trumpism than an extension of the
besieged, paranoid worldview that got him elected in the first place.
In 2018, well after the debunking of Pizzagate—the allegation that
Hillary Clinton and a secret cabal were running a pedophile ring out of
a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant—the network hired one of
Pizzagate’s chief boosters, Jack Posobiec, as an on-air correspondent.
(Posobiec has backed down from the Pizzagate theory, telling [The
Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/pizzagate-from-rumor-to-hashtag-to-gunfire-in-dc/2016/12/06/4c7def50-bbd4-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html)
in 2016 that he thought his live-streamed look into the pizzeria “could
just show it was a regular pizza place.”) OAN covered the so-called
migrant caravan—a slow-moving wave of migrants that began rolling north
from Central America in 2018—as if it were a Category 5 hurricane. OAN
has referred to the 2016 murder of Seth Rich, a Democratic National
Committee employee, as if it might have been a political assassination;
tin-foil-hat corners of the internet have connected it to the leaking
of DNC emails. Recently, OAN has been advancing the theory, without any
evidence to support it, that the coronavirus was developed in a Chinese
bioweapons lab, and spread from there. Soon enough, The New York Times
reported that administration officials were pushing the intelligence
services to investigate, even as the theory was debunked on the front
page.

“Our big secret and a key differentiator of OAN from other cable news
networks is that the star of OAN’s news lineup is the news, not the
talent,” Charles Herring, the network’s president, told me by email
recently. Now on the one hand, ouch—on-air talent likes nothing more
than hearing their boss say they weren’t chosen for their talent. On
the other hand, he’s right: At OAN, what comes out of their mouths is
far more important than how well they say it. To watch OAN is to
experience the Trump presidency the way Trump himself would cover it,
if he built a network from the ground up and then, as he did with his
administration, hired amateurs to run it. I spent hours watching OAN,
and the whole time I found myself yearning for the skill and
professionalism of Fox News. In the age of alternative facts, though, a
news network doesn’t need polish to be dangerous. All the talent needs
to do is look into the camera and read off the teleprompter.

Trump’s frequent shout-outs have turned OAN into a minor media
sensation, and its coverage has been described as “fast paced,” which
is only true if you’re comparing it with the burning-Yule-log channel.
As I watched One America, it gradually dawned on me that I was watching
Anchorman. Everything was so earnest and slapdash, and so transparently
inane. In both appearance and metabolism, OAN is a nostalgia
machine—familiar, reassuring, the Turner Classic Movies of cable-news
networks. It’s built for the members of an aging #MAGA army who want to
be comforted by news the way they remember it. The same good news, the
same bad news. The same invisible enemies too, so that even the
nightmares come wrapped in a warm blanket. Gang violence at the top of
the hour, baby pandas at the bottom. OAN is post-parody: It’s the
straight truth for Trump fans, and completely surreal for everyone
else.

OAN was born on the Fourth of July seven years ago, when Trump was
already deep into his birtherism phase. The network is headquartered in
an office-park cul-de-sac in San Diego, a city that, in addition to
being the setting for Anchorman, is the longtime corporate base of One
America’s founder, the microchip multimillionaire and aging
paterfamilias Robert Herring, Charles’s father. Robert built his
fortune as a manufacturer of circuit boards, cashing out of two
companies in 2000 with $122 million. He and Charles broke into
television in 2004 with WealthTV, now known as AWE (A Wealth of
Entertainment), a cable channel that would feature shows such as Cheese
Chasers and Dream Cruises. Robert also started giving money to
conservative causes. In 2005, he made news when he offered $1 million
to the husband of Terri Schiavo—a young woman who spent years in a
vegetative state as her husband and parents fought in court over
whether to end her life—if he agreed to keep her on life support. (He
declined the offer.) When Robert and his son decided that Fox News had
gotten too soft, too centrist, they launched One America to compete
with it.

Robert Herring does not poke his head out much, granting only the
occasional brief interview to his local San Diego Union-Tribune. Since
the coronavirus pandemic began, though, he has been tweeting about it
regularly. On April 20, he posted about hydroxychloroquine, the
antimalarial drug that Trump has touted as a cure for COVID-19—and now
claims to have taken himself—despite the lack of evidence that
hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for the coronavirus and
the emerging evidence that it may cause harm:

Not a word of this tweet is accurate, not even the part about Trump
being the first to tell us about the drug. Robert just lobbed it out
there, and then vanished behind his Twitter account. Like its founder,
One America does not reveal much about itself. A two-page media kit on
the network website carries this boast about One America: “Fast
becoming the 4th rated national cable news channel!” But I couldn’t
find a single press contact. The anchors seem to have written their own
bios, possibly copied from their Tinder profiles. Emily Finn, who is
23, according to anchorswiki.com, is described as someone who loves
traveling (“especially to Dublin, Ireland … her most favorite place in
the whole world”) as well as “jamming to some classic rock music, or
soaking up the sun at the beach.” I scoured the site, clicking on every
tab, until I happened to click on a page called “Affiliate Relations,”
and there it was, kindly supplied for OAN viewers: Charles Herring’s
direct email address. So I emailed him. He emailed right back.

“One America News Network is a small family business,” Charles wrote
when I told him I’d been surprised to find his personal contact
information right there on the OAN site. “Our staff does the best job
they can do with the resources we have. Many of our staff members play
numerous roles, including me.” In another email, Charles wrote: “Glad
that you have taken the time to watch on Roku (and thank you for the
$4.99 per month!) You’ll get a good sense of the channel by watching,
rather than reading opinions from advocacy ‘journalists’ [who] admit
they have never watched the channel. Let me know how I can be helpful.”

Anyone with a mobile device can watch One America in chunks on YouTube,
or through the network’s app, or on the streaming service Roku, but the
majority of One America’s viewers are, like Trump, TV watchers. In
order to watch it on TV, you have to live in the right place, because
only a smattering of U.S. cable operators carry OAN, representing a
potential pool of about 35 million households, or less than a third of
the total U.S. television audience. The network’s precise viewership
remains a mystery. The Herrings don’t participate in Nielsen surveys
and have declined to share subscriber data. But according to the scant
available data from Comscore and conversations with industry analysts,
at least 34.5 million of those households are not watching OAN.

The more you search for evidence of OAN viewers, in fact, the less they
seem to exist. “If you look at the constellation of sources around the
2020 election, OAN registers but it doesn’t make the top thousand,”
says Ethan Zuckerman, a Web 2.0 pioneer and media and public-policy
professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. “That
surprised me … but it seems like they’re really focused on being a TV
network rather than a multimedia platform.” Indeed, most of the
segments on OAN’s YouTube page have just a few thousand views. OAN
often gets compared to Breitbart News, but it exemplifies a reversal of
Brietbart’s strategy under Steve Bannon, which sought to leverage
social media aggressively. One America may be relatively new, but it
seems almost pre-web.

“Breitbart really embraced this idea that it wanted to be shareable in
all these sorts of formats—they wanted to show up in video, they wanted
to go viral,” Zuckerman told me. “I don’t think that’s the game OAN is
playing.”

Charles Herring was right: In order to understand OAN, you have to take
in every second of airtime, from the Wikimedia stock footage of pills
on a factory belt to the advertisements for military-grade tactical
sunglasses. And then you have to think about what the hell happened in
the world to produce such a sealed-off vision of modern
life—half-comforting, half-paranoid, like a Truman Show for angry
retirees. Every so often, you feel an invisible hand at work. On April
17, shortly after Trump picked a fight with the [protective-mask
manufacturer 3M](https://apnews.com/cbed1f366882b07ecc5a45cdee9f4e1e),
line, “works even better than 3M’s N95 mask.” The [nurse boasted](https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2020/04/16/local-nurse-designs-mask-with-995-filtration-efficiency/)
about her mask’s 99.5 percent filtration rate (which, if true, would be
better than 3M’s) and the fact that so far she’d made 600 of them. The
premise of this segment seemed to be: Eat it, 3M! Just a few commercial
breaks later, an advertisement urged viewers who’d suffered hearing
damage from faulty earplugs to join a class-action lawsuit against …
3M. Coincidence? Maybe. In One America’s America, though, there are no
coincidences. Everything is a conspiracy.

All of One America’s anchors bear an uncanny resemblance to more famous
anchors on other networks. The bespectacled, babyish-faced Alex Salvi
hosts a prime-time show called After Hours that airs at 10 p.m., but
before you get any naughty ideas, it’s more like watching a high-school
production of All In With Chris Hayes. Then there’s Graham Ledger, who
spent nearly 15 years anchoring San Diego’s KFMB-TV local news, which
means that, yes, prior to joining WealthTV and One America, he was
Anchorman’s Ron Burgundy. You could spend all day fuming about border
security and still fall asleep face-first into a bowl of Ledger’s word
soup. One of the soft bigotries of right-leaning opinion journalism is
that brunettes don’t get to be righteously indignant—this is a job for
spitfire blondes. Liz Wheeler, the host of 9 p.m.’s Tipping Point, is a
slightly desiccated Megyn Kelly whose hobbies include emasculating the
libs. If Ledger is OAN’s bid to take back the Anchorman archetype,
Wheeler is a conservative fantasy of Ron Burgundy’s love interest and
rival co-anchor, Veronica Corningstone.

Doppelgängers abound. Patrick Hussion, who hosts OAN nightly news at 5
p.m., which is technically the late afternoon, looks haunted, like a
half-in-the-bag David Muir. John Hines, who interviews many of OAN’s
big gets—regulars include Representative Devin Nunes of California and
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar—has mastered Chris
Wallace’s very sober manner, right down to the very sober head tilt.
Wallace, though, is a born inquisitor. Hines is trained to heel. One
afternoon, I watched him hold an expression of squinty encouragement
for nearly five unbroken minutes as Nunes went on about a “highly
suspicious” weapons lab in Wuhan and about the World Health
Organization’s alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

If you’ve encountered OAN out in the world, though, it’s probably not
because of Ledger or Hines or Hussion. One America gets talked about
for one overriding reason: Trump keeps calling on its correspondents
during press conferences. By now, a pattern has emerged. He calls on an
OAN correspondent; the correspondent asks a bewildering question;
everyone in the briefing room turns around to see who the hell just
asked the bewildering question; then Trump thanks the correspondent for
serving up such an incisive meatball. For weeks, Trump labored to shift
blame for the pandemic onto China by referring to the coronavirus as
the “China virus” or “Wuhan virus,” provoking charges of thinly veiled
racism. He received a helpful boost from OAN’s chief White House
correspondent, Chanel Rion, whose name is pronounced Sha-nell Ree-ohn.
(Rion is Korean American; her father’s surname is Ryan.) Her question
on the matter was more akin to a preemptive defense with a question
mark stuck on the end: “Mr. President, do you consider the term Chinese
food to be racist because it is food that originated from China?”

Rion does seem to have a knack for head-scratching behavior. According
to a Daily Mail investigation, she changed her surname from Dayn-Ryan
to Rion shortly before applying for a White House security clearance
(which is a peculiar moment to change your name). The newspaper
reported that Rion’s father, Dann Ryan, has gone by the names
Christopher Preboth, Dan Ryan, Danford Nmi Dayn-Ryan, Michael David
Ryan, and David Michael Ryan. One reason he may have changed his name
so many times is because, according to the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8181867/Fake-conman-dad-questionable-resume-Truth-Chanel-Rion-Trumps-favorite-reporter.html)
account, he kept getting accused of defrauding people in real-estate
scams.

Breaking news is very expensive and, for the Herrings and One America,
very overrated. Charles Herring has said that his family pumps tens of
millions of dollars into One America, but for a national TV-news
operation, that’s pennies in a bottomless well. In all the hours I
spent watching One America during the pandemic, I never saw evidence of
a second camera in the studio. I never saw a field correspondent
deliver a report from anywhere other than the White House. Some of the
male anchors should not be dressing themselves.

In any case, why break news when you can just repeat the already broken
stuff? When I emailed Charles about what he considers the high points
of OAN’s history as a news network—an incisive meatball of my own—he
didn’t seize the open invitation to boast. “The high points,” he
replied, “are simply executing on our mission, namely providing
credible national and international news. Having staff break important
news stories is always a high point for any news organization.” It sure
is. But he didn’t name any of those stories.

I thought Charles might tout the network’s hard-hitting coverage of the
2020 presidential election, in particular its coverage of Joe Biden. A
vague theme emerged from the many segments I watched—see if you can
spot it: “Joe Biden stumbled through another interview today …”
“Concerns about his cognitive decline are reportedly on the rise …”
“Joe Biden’s gaffes continue—that’s according to his harshest critics.”
(Yes, even Biden’s harshest critics were willing to speak out.) The
anchors hit their prescribed marks with a mixture of amusement and
pity. They could barely contain themselves at a clip of Biden referring
to the coronavirus as “the Luhan virus.”

In my email exchange with Charles, I tried to nail down a few more
answers. Given the tenor of One America’s pandemic coverage, I asked
him if he personally knew anyone who had become ill with COVID-19. For
some reason, he didn’t want to reply on the record. I also asked him
for examples of times OAN has had to correct its work, because I
couldn’t find very many myself. “Unfortunately, we make errors on a
frequent basis,” he replied. “Most are very minor and simply corrected.
At times, we’ve made on air corrections.” One correction I did find was
a “report removal” tweet walking back an infidelity accusation; the
tweet repeated the original accusation and stated that the item was
removed “pending additional sourcing.” Charles is right about how often
One America gets things wrong, but wrong about how often One America
sets them right.

Despite its tiny audience, One America can still be a useful vector for
propagandists, both foreign and domestic, even unwittingly. A
conspiracy theory that pops up only in, say, a Russian propaganda
organ, or in the mouth of a spiral-eyed congressman, can’t travel as
widely as one that receives some sort of American media imprimatur,
however shabby.

This requires a bit of a dance to work. For instance, a guest can
speculate ominously about Chinese plots, but the interviewer has to sit
there, thunderstruck by the logic of it all, and not ask even the most
basic of questions. Okay, walk me through this: Scientists in a Chinese
bioweapons lab developed the coronavirus and then ... what? Turned it
loose on their own people? Or did it get out by accident—a monkey
escaped, a test tube spilled, that sort of thing? Liberated from
critical probing, innuendo does its work.

For years, coastal elites roared with laughter at Jon Stewart and
Stephen Colbert as they dressed up as newsmen and turned a familiar
ritual of American life into a nightly punch line. Throughout the Obama
presidency, liberals comforted themselves with the idea that they’d
mocked a certain kind of news program out of existence, and that sanity
had triumphed. But during Barack Obama’s second term, the post-truth
pendulum swung back hard, from left to far right, from parody to
propaganda, from Obama doctrine to Trumpism.

One America may be Donald Trump’s favorite news network, but that
doesn’t mean he stays up all night watching it. If there’s one thing we
can all agree that Trump really does know something about, it’s good
(“good”) television, and I just can’t picture him having any patience
for One America’s production values. “The key to success in this space
is that you actually have to look enough like a news network to have
some influence … and that’s what Breitbart did incredibly well,”
Zuckerman, the media analyst, said. “It really has to have luster and
gloss to it. And then when it’s simultaneously disturbing, that’s when
it has power.” OAN, though, skipped the luster-and-gloss part.
Zuckerman went on, “If you don’t have it—even if the product is really
provocative—it’s going to fail.”

So many times while watching One America, I went back and forth about
how “dangerous” it is, how alarmed we should be, what threat level it
represents. One America’s sponsorship roster remains on the skimpy
side—appliance insurance, class-action suits against Trump foes, a
selection from the William Shatner oeuvre. The network has survived
this long only because of the oxygen hose that Trump provides. And when
he’s gone? One America isn’t Fox News. The Herrings aren’t the
Murdochs. Someone else will replace them. It might be someone with much
better news chops. It might be someone more insidiously adept at using
the cover of journalism to erode trust in journalism. It might even be
people with ties to Trump. According to [news reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-allies-explore-buyout-of-conservative-news-channel-one-america-news-network-11578696767),
the investment firm owned by the family of the Republican National
Committee co-chair and Texas investor Tommy Hicks Jr., a friend of
Donald Trump Jr., has been exploring possible options.

Charles Herring demurred when I asked him about the rumors. “We didn’t
build OAN to sell it and we are excited about the future,” he wrote.
“We’ll look at any growth opportunities, yet we are not looking to sell
our business.” In that case, for the time being, let’s savor a virtue
of the network that just about everyone can acknowledge: It’s
unwatchable.
