## Free Software (Open Source)
I'm a huge fan of the Free Software Movement, though I don't always live up to
its highest ideals. For better or worse, I'm a pragmatist when it comes to
choosing software to use. But I'm a huge believer in sharing my own work and
enjoy it immensely.

### Computer hardware
#### Early years
Since I was a young boy, I've always been fascinated by computers. The first bit
of digital technology that transfixed me was owned by my cousin's husband, Jimmy
Wagner. It was a digital watch with growing LED numbers. It was probably 1975
and I was 5 years old. If the watch wasn't the [Pulsar P3](https://20centurywatches.com/pulsar-p3/), it was something very close to it.
I begged for my own digital watch for a present but that, of course, my
relatives weren't about to spend a couple hundred bucks on a watch for a little
kid (I did get a Snoopy analog watch, though). I don't think it was until 1979
that I finally got a digital watch. Although it was a liquid crystal display and
not LED, it was good enough for me.

Here's a historical timeline of some of the other hardware I've owned as well as
other experiences that left a mark on my imagination.

#### The Apple FanBoi Years
I've kind of lost track of all the Apple products I've purchased over the past
12 years. Here they are to the best of my recollection. I've probably spent
roughly $30K on them which is probably a bit obsessive, I'll admit. We've all
got our vices.

I'm currently waiting for the new iMac Pro line on the ARM architecture to
replace my aging iMac 5K machine. It might be a couple of years.
