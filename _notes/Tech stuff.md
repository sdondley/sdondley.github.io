## Free Software (Open Source)
I'm a huge fan of the Free Software Movement, though I don't always live up to
its highest ideals. For better or worse, I'm a pragmatist when it comes to
choosing software to use. But I'm a huge believer in sharing my own work and
enjoy it immensely.

### Computer hardware
#### Early years
Since I was a young boy, I've always been fascinated by all things digital. The
first bit of technology to transfix me was owned by my cousin's husband,
Jimmy Wagner. It was a watch and instead of hands it had glowing LED numbers. It
was probably 1975 and I was 5 years old. If the watch wasn't the [Pulsar
P3](https://20centurywatches.com/pulsar-p3/), it was something very close to
it.

I begged my parents and relatives for a digital watch as a present but, of
course, they weren't about to spend a couple hundred bucks on a watch for a
little kid (I did get a cool Snoopy analog watch, though). I don't think it was
until 1979 that I finally got a digital watch. Although it had a liquid crystal
display rather than an LED face and had an ugly, goofy, stiff brown plastic
wristband that was supposed to look like alligator skin, it was good enough for
me.

Here's a rough timeline of some of the other hardware I've owned as well as
other experiences that left a mark on my imagination.

* 1977?
  * [Little Professor - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Professor)

      * I'm not sure if he ever intended to use it for himself but he never did
        so it essentially became mine.

        been better than Doom

    * Video games basically killed my budding career in programming
* 1984
  * My sister and brother-in-law had an original Macintosh computer
    * Didn't have much need for it but was absolutely fascinated by it and spent
      hours on it seeing what it could do compared to my Apple IIe
  * My brother-in-law worked in the software industry and had some kind of
    printing device (I think it was some kind of portable teletype machine)
    connected to a modem. I could play games on it.

  * Set up a Linux box on an old, second-hand computer

      idea what I was doing.

  * Taught myself [Perl](/Perl)

#### The Apple FanBoi Years
I've kind of lost track of all the Apple products I've purchased over the past
12 years. Here they are to the best of my recollection. I've spent roughly $30K
on them which is probably a bit obsessive, I'll admit. We've all got our vices.

* 2008
  * Came back to Mac and never looked back with a MacBook Pro
* 2009
  * got the [iPhone 3GS - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_3GS)

  * iMac
    * Still in use today, primarily as a third monitor to my iMac 5K
  * iPad

  * iPhone 4S
* 2012
  * New MacBook Pro
  * got another iPad somewhere around this time

I'm currently waiting for the new iMac Pro line on the ARM architecture to
replace my aging iMac 5K machine. It might be a couple of years.
