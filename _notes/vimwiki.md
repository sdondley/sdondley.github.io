## What is it?

vimwiki is a [vim](/vim) plugin that helps you write a wiki, which is just a
collection of hyperlinked documents.

## What makes it so good?

I'm still learning the ropes but the short answer is:

1. Double tap `<enter>` on word or highlighte group of words to open and edit
   a new wike page.
2. Type into your new document
3. Hit `<backspace>` to return to your original document
4. Easily navigate between your wiki pages
5. Easily maintain a diary. See [keeping a diary](/Keeping-a-diary)

## Random tech notes
* vimwiki is running out of my `~/git_repos` directory using the
  `customizations` branch
