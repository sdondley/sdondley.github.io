## Todo
* test out new bi-directional link generation

#### [markdown_to_note](/markdown_to_note) code
* added code for generating backlinks for notes that may not exist yet
* added logic to ignore links in fenced code
* fixed other various, insidious bugs
* re-enabled backlink generation function

## Totally random but thought-provoking junk
