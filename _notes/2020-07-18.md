## Todo
* fix new bug where map for generating hyperlinks to other notes doesn't seem to
  work anymore

  * See [vimscript - Inconsistent behavior from map - Vi and Vim Stack Exchange](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/26531/inconsistent-behavior-from-map/26532?noredirect=1#comment47152_26532)

## Stuff done
* Digital gardening
  * escaped pipe character in url description of markdown when [inserting hyper links](/Insert-hyper-links)
  * fixed bug in [markdown_to_note](/markdown_to_note) where updated posts were
    not getting flag removed
* installed fzf and fzf.vim plugin

## Quick notes
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
  * useful for [Digital Gardening](/Digital-Gardening)?

  * installed [fzf](/fzf) and [fzf vim](/fzf.vim)
