A methane leak in Antarctica provides new insight into how methane-eating microbes evolve

Photo: These ocean-dwelling methane-hungry microbes are one of Earth's great hopes
for mitigating global warming.

Deep underwater in the Ross Sea off the coast of Antarctica, scientists
have discovered a new active leak of methane, a greenhouse gas far more
potent than carbon dioxide. The discovery marked the first time that
scientists were able to directly observe a new underwater methane seep, and
see how methane-eating microbial life in its proximity evolved over a
five-year span. 

In a study published in the peer-reviewed Proceedings of the Royal
Society B, a research team led by Oregon State University
oceanographer Dr. Andrew Thurber explained that the methane gas leak was
first discovered in 2011 off Antarctic shores. Antarctica is believed to
have as much as a quarter of the planet's ocean-based methane trapped in
permafrost and on the continental shelves.

Just as micro-organisms like fungi breed like crazy in the presence of a
food source in our homes — say, an open soda can or jam jar left out in
the open — methane-eating microbes are present in small numbers spread
throughout Earth's oceans, and only multiply precipitously when they find
a prominent "food" source like a methane seep. Indeed, the scientists note
that by 2016, methane-consuming micro-organisms began appearing by the leak
and consuming a small portion of the gas, though not enough to offset the
methane venting. 

In the case of this Ross Sea methane seep, researchers sought to quantify
the "response rate" of the microbial community over time — in other
words, how fast these microbes took up residence around the seep, and how
much methane they took in before it could reach the atmosphere. Five years
after the seep's formation, researchers noted that the microbial mat "had
not yet formed a sufficient filter to mitigate the release of methane from
the sediment."

The discovery is particularly interesting in that the chronology of these
kinds of phenomena is not well-understood; prior to this paper, it was
unknown how long microbial life would take to filter methane in a similar
methane seep. The researchers said that five years after the seep's
forming, the microbes were still in an "early successional stage."

"This study provides the first report of the evolution of a seep system
from a non-seep environment, and reveals that the rate of microbial
succession may have an unrealized impact on greenhouse gas emission from
marine methane reservoirs," they wrote.

The presence of methane increases the amount of heat trapped in the
atmosphere. From a warming perspective, it is preferably that microbes
consume the methane first and produce carbon dioxide — which is still a
greenhouse gas, though not nearly as potent as methane, which absorbs 25
times more heat in the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide.

"Our results suggest that the accuracy of future global climate models may
be improved by considering the time it will take for microbial communities
to respond to novel methane input," the authors write.

Salon reached out to a pair of climatologists for their thoughts on the
study. The common observation, which was made in the study itself, is that
the methane leak itself did not appear to have occurred strictly because of
global warming, though that is a scenario that scientists are actively
concerned about. 

"This study really just demonstrates a potential pathway by which Antarctic
marine methane can escape to the atmosphere," Dr. [Michael E. Mann](/Michael-E.-Mann), a
distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University,
told Salon by email. "It doesn't demonstrate that climate change has lead
to any increase in methane emissions. Relevant to this latter point is a
study that just came out a week showing that methane increases in the
atmosphere are due to natural gas extraction ('fracking') and livestock
methane emissions. There is no evidence that 'methane feedbacks' are
contributing to rising methane, at least not presently."

Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a Distinguished Senior Scientist in the Climate
Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research at the
University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, made a similar point in an
email to Salon.

"Methane concentrations in the atmosphere have increased prominently in the
past few years, and a significant source is from leaky fracking
installations and the resulting fugitive emissions," Trenberth explained.
After reviewing the economics of fracking during the coronavirus pandemic
— and in particular how some of the industry has gone bust — Trenberth
responded to the paper by writing that it "illuminates largely natural
processes in the southern ocean. Carbon of various sorts (wood, sea weed,
etc) decays and forms either carbon dioxide (if aerobic) or methane (if
anaerobic and immersed in water). Certain different kinds of bacteria
flourish under both conditions. My understanding is that a lot of methane
from depth in the ocean is absorbed rather than emitted into the
atmosphere. That would be a key question."

He added, "What surprises me about this article is that the southern oceans
are far from friendly to work in. There are strong winds and huge waves,
and how they can even accomplish this work would be of interest. . .
.  Are their results biased as a result? In any case, evidently rich and
new biogeochemistry has been discovered and can only help understanding and
modeling."
