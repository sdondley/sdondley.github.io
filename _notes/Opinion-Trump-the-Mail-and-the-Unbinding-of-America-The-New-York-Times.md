The Postal Service facilitates citizen inclusion. That’s why Trump
hates it.

In June the independent website Factcheck.org made a dig at Joe Biden,
publishing a [post](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/biden-floats-baseless-election-conspiracy/)
titled “Biden Floats Baseless Election Conspiracy.” Biden, you see, had
suggested hat Donald Trump “wants to cut off money for the post office
so they cannot deliver mail-in ballots.” There was, said the post, no
evidence that Trump’s “stance toward the U.S. postal system is related
to the presidential election.”

A few days ago Factcheck.org conceded that Biden had, in fact, been
right. The confirmation? Trump’s [own statements](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/trump-proves-biden-right-on-usps-funding-mail-in-ballots/).

Nancy Pelosi is calling the House [back from summer recess](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/us/politics/coronavirus-postal-service-stimulus-bill.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
to consider legislation on the issue, and for good reason: There are
not one but two possible constitutional crises looming. In one,
millions of votes never get counted. In the other, delays in the
counting of mail-in votes lead Trump to claim victory in an election he
actually lost.

These November nightmares are the reason we need to act urgently to
secure the integrity of America’s mail. But there’s also a larger,
longer-term aspect to the assault on the postal system. It’s part of a
broader attack on the institutions that bind us together as a nation.

There was, after all, a reason the Constitution specifically [granted](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-8/clause-7/)
Congress the ability to “establish post offices and post roads.”
Clearly, the founders saw some kind of national postal system as one
way to help turn the still shaky idea of the United States as a nation
into reality. In fact, in its early years one of the post office’s key
roles was the delivery of [newspapers](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2020/05/tumultuous-history-united-states-postal-service-constant-fight-survival/),
as a way to keep Americans informed and connected.

The Postal Service as we know it now didn’t emerge all at once.
Instead, it evolved gradually, through an accumulation of both formal
legislation and precedents.

Direct delivery of mail to urban homes didn’t begin until 1863, and
permanent rural free delivery until 1902. The [Parcel Post](https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2015/rarc-wp-14-004_0.pdf)
wasn’t created until 1913; previously, rural customers had to rely on a
cartel of private companies that conspired to keep shipping rates high.

All these changes, however, had a common theme: bringing Americans into
better contact with one another and the world at large. A key part of
the post office’s ethos has long been that it has a “[universal service
obligation](https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2015/rarc-wp-15-001_0.pdf),”
“binding the nation together” and “facilitating citizen inclusion.”

For much of America’s history this largely involved bringing remote
areas access to the fruits of urban economic progress; it’s hard to
overstate how much difference the rise of the [mail-order business](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/sears-postal-service-catalogs),
made possible by postal expansion, made to the quality of rural life.
And postal delivery remains crucial in rural areas, which are poorly
(and [expensively](https://www.prc.gov/sites/default/files/archived/Rural_Service_Report.pdf))
served by [private](/private) delivery companies.

But it’s not just the rural population; the Postal Service remains a
lifeline, sometimes literally, for many Americans who for whatever
reason have limited ability to, say, visit a pharmacy to pick up
prescriptions. The Department of Veterans Affairs delivers about [80
percent](https://www.pbm.va.gov/PBM/CMOP/VA_Mail_Order_Pharmacy.asp) of
its outpatient prescriptions by mail.

As the mail-in voting crisis has erupted, some of the usual suspects on
the right have taken to denouncing the Postal Service as a bad,
money-losing business. But the founders didn’t put the postal clause in
the Constitution because they saw it as a business opportunity; the
Postal Service was supposed to serve broader national goals — and it
still does.

But, you may ask, why should this logic apply only to the mail?
Shouldn’t we support other institutions that bind the nation together?
Yes, we should — and do.

The [Rural Electrification Administration](https://eh.net/encyclopedia/rural-electrification-administration/),
created in the 1930s to bring power to rural areas, was about national
integration as well as economic development — and beginning in 1949 it
subsidized the expansion of rural telephone networks, too. The
Interstate Highway System was justified in part with dubious claims
about national security, but it had the effect of reinforcing national
unity.

What about the internet? Should we have a policy to ensure that
Americans have access to modern telecommunications, too? Actually, yes.

Internet access in America is [far more expensive](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/2/18/21126347/antitrust-monopolies-internet-telecommunications-cheerleading)
than in other advanced countries, because largely unregulated private
providers abuse their market power, much like the private shippers that
exploited farmers before the creation of the Parcel Post.

Of course, we don’t expect every service in the modern economy to be
subject to a universal service obligation. We don’t all need golf
course memberships or [private boats](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fox-news-host-compares-trump-boat-parade-to-the-spanish-armada-theres-only-one-problem-2020-08-16)
to participate fully in our national life.

But most Americans — presumably including most of the [91 percent](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/04/09/public-holds-broadly-favorable-views-of-many-federal-agencies-including-cdc-and-hhs/)
of the public with a favorable view of the Postal Service — believe
that there are some things that should be universally available, even
if providing those things isn’t profitable, because they’re important
components of full citizenship.

Unfortunately, Trump and those around him don’t share that belief,
perhaps because they don’t really buy into this notion of “full
citizenship” in the first place. And that’s one reason they might have
been trying to cripple the post office even if it weren’t their best
hope of stealing this election.
