## Todo
* improve navigation between diary entries
  * create links to go back and forth between pages
* integrate todos with Taskwiki

## Stuff done
* researched how to create a template for diary entries
  * used damian conway's autocmd
    * [thoughtstream/Damian-Conway-s-Vim-Setup: Snapshots of my Vim setup. Open
      source, but utterly unsupported...and probably
      dangerous.](https://github.com/thoughtstream/Damian-Conway-s-Vim-Setup)
    * runs ~/bin/vim_file_template perl script
      * loads template file from ~/.vim_templates dir
      * added a few lines of perl for files that begin with dates and have .md
        extension
        * just a quick hack
