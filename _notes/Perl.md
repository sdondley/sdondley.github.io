Perl is my native programming language and the one I know the best. It was the
lingua franca back in the late 90s when I first started web development.

Perl gets knocked around quite a bit these day for not being elegant. Maybe it
is, and maybe it isn't, I'm not knowledgeable enough about programming languages
to provide a definitive answer. All I know is it's useful for me and its the
easieast way for me to get things done.

Here are the [perl modules I've written and contributed.](https://metacpan.org/author/STEVIED) The are of varying quality
and usefulness.

Over the last couple of years, I have made a concerted effort to improve my
programming quality and skills.
