* Author: Anne Applebaum
* Publication: The Atlantic

## Interesting facts
* Ingraham was featured as one of the featured conservatives on 1995 New York
  Times Magazine cover

## Juicy excerpts
* The America of the present, as she sees it, is a dark, nightmarish place where
  God speaks to only a tiny number of people; where idealism is dead; where
  civil war and violence are approaching; where democratically elected
  politicians are no better than foreign dictators and mass murderers; where the
  “elite” is wallowing in decadence, disarray, death.
*  If it weren’t for her faith, she said, “I wouldn’t be here . . . I probably
   wouldn’t be alive.” That was why, she said, she fought to save America from
   the godless: “If we lose faith in God, as a country—we lose our country.”
   * *Yeah, she's a total kook*
