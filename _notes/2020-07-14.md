## Personal and technical notes
* New diary entry. Testing.
* Testing of diary index automatic generation with [vimwiki](/vimwiki)
  * Seems to work weirdly
    * When you open diary index, it just creates a brand new index at bottom of
      the diary index document instead of replacing it.
    * This has possibly been resolved by providing a different default header
      for the diary index page in `g:vimwiki_list`:
      * `let wiki_1.diary_header = 'Diary Index'`
* vimwiki links in diary link to files in `diary` subfolder by default.
  * Not ideal.
  * Possible to change this behavior?
  * Looking at vimwiki documentation
    * Looks like diary_rel_path will do the trick
    * can also change diary_header
      * defaults to "Diary"
        * needed: "Diary Index"
  * RESOLVED: diary entries are no long created in own subdirectory
* refactored and improved [markdown_to_note](/markdown_to_note) code
* improved the mappings for adding links from open Safari browser tab into vim
  * added notes about the mapping
