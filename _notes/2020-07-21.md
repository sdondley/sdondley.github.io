## Stuff done
* greatly improved efficiency of how bi-directional links are generated
  * :VimwikiAll2HTML command no longer necessary
  * [markdown_to_note](/markdown_to_note) recognizes when a link has been removed
    or added to a markdown file
    * bi-directional links are added and removed from other files as appropriate
      * happens when file is saved

## Totally random but thought-provoking junk
