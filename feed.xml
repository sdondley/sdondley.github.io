Rex is a great time saver. Unfortunately, its documentation is rather disjointed and a bit cryptic. This post tries to flatten the learning curve a bit by offering some big picture ideas and fine-grained recipes to get you productively using the Rex framework faster than you would otherwise.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Setting Up Multiple Project Areas with Taskwarrior</title><link href="https://steve.dondley.com/setting-up-multiple-project-areas-with-task-warrior/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Setting Up Multiple Project Areas with Taskwarrior" /><published>2019-04-30T00:30:19-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-30T00:30:19-04:00</updated><id>https://steve.dondley.com/setting-up-multiple-project-areas-with-task-warrior</id><author><name>{&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;sdondley@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steve Dondley&quot;}</name><email>sdondley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="task management" /><category term="taskwarrior" /><summary type="html">Preface Taskwarrior (TW) is an open source task management platform built for those who prefer to work on the command line. Like most command line tools with any sophistication, it has a learning curve that, at first, requires a fairly significant investment of time in order take advantage of its best features. But like any serious tool, once mastered, your time invested will pay off in spades with much increased efficiency and much less agony dealing with a GUI that slows you down and makes you want to scratch your eyeballs out. The Problem Out of the box, TW dumps all of your projects into one list. Yes, there are ways you can filter these lists. But there are cases where you may want to have a separate project area dedicated to certain types of projects. For example, you may have one task list that you share with others and another that you’d prefer to keep private.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://steve.dondley.com/images/hero/warrior.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://steve.dondley.com/images/hero/warrior.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Change the name of current directory from the command line</title><link href="https://steve.dondley.com/change-the-name-of-current-directory-from-the-command-line/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Change the name of current directory from the command line" /><published>2019-04-21T12:29:49-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-21T12:29:49-04:00</updated><id>https://steve.dondley.com/change-the-name-of-current-directory-from-the-command-line</id><author><name>{&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;sdondley@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steve Dondley&quot;}</name><email>sdondley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="bash" /><category term="tech tips" /><summary type="html">Here is a simple bash function for renaming the current directory you are in from the command line: rename_current_dir() { cd=${PWD##*/} cd .. mv $cd $1 cd $1 } Create an alias of your choice to this command so it's easier to type: alias rncd='rename_current_dir'</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://steve.dondley.com/images/hero/spiral.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://steve.dondley.com/images/hero/spiral.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Setting up a “split DNS” configuration on a Synology NAS for hosting websites</title><link href="https://steve.dondley.com/setting-up-a-split-dns-configuration-on-a-synology-nas-for-hosting-websites/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Setting up a “split DNS” configuration on a Synology NAS for hosting websites" /><published>2019-04-20T17:25:03-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-20T17:25:03-04:00</updated><id>https://steve.dondley.com/setting-up-a-split-dns-configuration-on-a-synology-nas-for-hosting-websites</id><author><name>{&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;sdondley@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steve Dondley&quot;}</name><email>sdondley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="dns" /><summary type="html">A Quick Primer on DNS Here's a very quick primer on the Domain Name System (DNS), a giant database distributed over millions of computers across the globe. It's primary job is to &quot;resolve,&quot; or look up, the IP address for a given human-readable internet address. For example, the &quot;google.com&quot; address meant for humans resolves to the IP address of &quot;172.217.6.206,&quot; the number that computers use to &quot;dial&quot; google's website up. This makes the internet much more convenient to use. Typing in long and not very memorable IP addresses is much more of a hassle than typing in an address made up of common letters and words.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://steve.dondley.com/images/hero/war.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://steve.dondley.com/images/hero/war.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Stop &amp;amp; Shop Strike Continues</title><link href="https://steve.dondley.com/stop-shop-strike-continues/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stop &amp;amp; Shop Strike Continues" /><published>2019-04-18T21:23:47-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-18T21:23:47-04:00</updated><id>https://steve.dondley.com/stop-shop-strike-continues</id><author><name>{&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;sdondley@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steve Dondley&quot;}</name><email>sdondley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Labor" /><category term="photography" /><summary type="html">Over 30,000 New England Stop &amp;amp; Shop grocery store workers continue their fight against Ahold Delhaize, the giant Dutch conglomerate which owns the chain. They have been on strike for about a week now. Today, I took a trip to the strike line on Liberty St. in Springfield. As my photos attest, the strike has been very effective. The store is a ghost town. However, Ahold is a multi-multi-muti-billion dollar business. They can afford to lose millions of dollars per week in their attempt to destroy the union. The workers on strike will be stretched far more thin than the company. Thanks to the Stop &amp;amp; Shop workers for fighting the good fight for workers taking a stand. And thanks to everyone supporting these workers by refusing to shop at Stop &amp;amp; Shop.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://steve.dondley.com/images/hero/sands.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://steve.dondley.com/images/hero/sands.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Super Guide to the split-window tmux Subcommand (and Beyond)</title><link href="https://steve.dondley.com/super-guide-to-the-split-window-tmux-subcommand-and-beyond/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Super Guide to the split-window tmux Subcommand (and Beyond)" /><published>2019-04-17T22:40:01-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-17T22:40:01-04:00</updated><id>https://steve.dondley.com/super-guide-to-the-split-window-tmux-subcommand-and-beyond</id><author><name>{&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;sdondley@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steve Dondley&quot;}</name><email>sdondley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="git" /><category term="tmux" /><category term="vim" /><summary type="html">I spent the last few days writing a beginner's guide for tmux users.
