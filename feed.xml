Like most command line tools with any sophistication, it has a learning curve that, at first, requires a fairly significant investment of time in order take advantage of its best features. But like any serious tool, once mastered, your time invested will pay off in spades with much increased efficiency and much less agony dealing with a GUI that slows you down and makes you want to scratch your eyeballs out. The Problem Out of the box, TW dumps all of your projects into one list. Yes, there are ways you can filter these lists. But there are cases where you may want to have a separate project area dedicated to certain types of projects. For example, you may have one task list that you share with others and another that you’d prefer to keep private.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Change the name of current directory from the command line</title><link href="https://steve.dondley.com/change-the-name-of-current-directory-from-the-command-line/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Change the name of current directory from the command line" /><published>2019-04-21T12:29:49-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-21T12:29:49-04:00</updated><id>https://steve.dondley.com/change-the-name-of-current-directory-from-the-command-line</id><author><name>{&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;sdondley@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steve Dondley&quot;}</name><email>sdondley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="bash" /><category term="tech tips" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Setting up a “split DNS” configuration on a Synology NAS for hosting websites</title><link href="https://steve.dondley.com/setting-up-a-split-dns-configuration-on-a-synology-nas-for-hosting-websites/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Setting up a “split DNS” configuration on a Synology NAS for hosting websites" /><published>2019-04-20T17:25:03-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-20T17:25:03-04:00</updated><id>https://steve.dondley.com/setting-up-a-split-dns-configuration-on-a-synology-nas-for-hosting-websites</id><author><name>{&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;sdondley@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steve Dondley&quot;}</name><email>sdondley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="dns" /><summary type="html">A Quick Primer on DNS Here's a very quick primer on the Domain Name System (DNS), a giant database distributed over millions of computers across the globe. It's primary job is to &quot;resolve,&quot; or look up, the IP address for a given human-readable internet address. For example, the &quot;google.com&quot; address meant for humans resolves to the IP address of &quot;172.217.6.206,&quot; the number that computers use to &quot;dial&quot; google's website up. This makes the internet much more convenient to use. Typing in long and not very memorable IP addresses is much more of a hassle than typing in an address made up of common letters and words.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stop &amp;amp; Shop Strike Continues</title><link href="https://steve.dondley.com/stop-shop-strike-continues/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stop &amp;amp; Shop Strike Continues" /><published>2019-04-18T21:23:47-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-18T21:23:47-04:00</updated><id>https://steve.dondley.com/stop-shop-strike-continues</id><author><name>{&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;sdondley@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steve Dondley&quot;}</name><email>sdondley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Labor" /><category term="photography" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Super Guide to the split-window tmux Subcommand (and Beyond)</title><link href="https://steve.dondley.com/super-guide-to-the-split-window-tmux-subcommand-and-beyond/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Super Guide to the split-window tmux Subcommand (and Beyond)" /><published>2019-04-17T22:40:01-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-17T22:40:01-04:00</updated><id>https://steve.dondley.com/super-guide-to-the-split-window-tmux-subcommand-and-beyond</id><author><name>{&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;sdondley@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steve Dondley&quot;}</name><email>sdondley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="git" /><category term="tmux" /><category term="vim" /><summary type="html">I spent the last few days writing a beginner's guide for tmux users.

It's very useful, but hard to master without sinking a lot of time into it.</summary></entry></feed>
