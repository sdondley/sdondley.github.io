Steve Dondley maintains this blog and digital garden (found in the ["Notes"](/notes/) section of this site). The subject matter is primarily focused on sharing technical knowledge and a futile attempt at returning the favor to all of those who have done the same.

## Who is Steve Dondley?
I am the owner and founder of [Prometheus Labor
Communications](http://prometheuslabor.com), a US Navy submarine veteran
and former labor organizer for UFCW Local 1459 in Springfield, MA. I've had an early
interest in computers and programming since childhood and a fascination with
mass communication which I developed during my post secondary education at
UMass. I combined these passions and began developing websites for labor unions in
in the late 90s. I launched my company, Prometheus, in 2005.

I continue to be involved in the labor movement and serves as the
Recording Secretary for my labor council in Springfield, MA. I also served a
two-year term as a city councilor in the city of Westfield, MA. I am currently
focused on the development of the [UnionConnect mobile app
platform](https://unionconnect.com) my company developed for labor unions among
many other projects.

## What's the significance of the pictures at the top of each page?

This [website theme I shamelessly ripped off](https://github.com/MaximeKjaer/kjaer.io) used
photos and I wanted to use my own. They are mostly photos I took while on a
family vacation in Europe. We went to quite a few museums so many of them are
art-focused. If there's any significance to them other than they might be
eye-catching, it is that I think life itself is a bit of performance
art.
