This blog is sporadically maintained by Steve Dondley. The subject matter is primarily focused on sharing technical knowledge and a futile attempt at returning the favor to all of those who have done the same.

## What's the significance of the pictures at the top of each page?

This [website theme I shamelessly ripped off](https://github.com/MaximeKjaer/kjaer.io) used
photos and I wanted to use my own. They are mostly photos I took while on a
family vacation in Europe. We went to quite a few museums so many of them are
art-focused. If there's any significance to them other than they might be
eye-catching, it is that I think life itself is a bit of performance
art.
