<h3 id="without-federal-aid-to-stave-off-the-impact-of-the-pandemic-and-economic-recession-households-that-were-already-on-the-margins-are-now-being-pushed-to-the-brink-of-financial-ruin">Without federal aid to stave off the impact of the pandemic and economic recession, households that were already on the margins are now being pushed to the brink of financial ruin.</h3>

<p>One of the most successful elements of the government’s response to the
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2">coronavirus</a>
recession — protecting people on the margins from falling into poverty
— is faltering as the safety net shrinks and federal benefits expire.</p>

<p>Major recessions are especially fraught for low-income earners, whose
finances can veer from tenuous to dire with one missed paycheck. But as
the economy cratered this spring, economists and poverty experts were
mildly surprised to discover that the torrent of government support
that followed — particularly the $600 a week in expanded unemployment
benefits and one-time $1,200 stimulus checks — likely lowered the
overall poverty rate.</p>

<p>In fact, 17 million people would have dropped below the poverty line
without the $500 billion in direct intervention for American families,
said Zach Parolin, a researcher at Columbia University.</p>

<p>Now, data show, those gains are eroding as federal inaction deprives
Americans on the financial margins of additional support. If the
unemployment rate stays around 10 percent and no new stimulus is
delivered, “we can expect poverty rates to rise and climb higher than
those observed in the Great Recession,” Parolin said. The poverty
threshold for a family of four is $26,200, according to the <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines">U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services.
</a></p>

<p>Data collected by the Census Bureau capture the financial pain. For the
week that ended July 21, the most recent numbers available, roughly 29
million U.S. adults — about 12.1 percent — said their household
sometimes or often didn’t have enough to eat the preceding seven days,
according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Nearly 15
million renters said they were behind on rent during the same period.</p>

<p>Bruce Meyer, a University of Chicago professor who studies poverty and
inequality, said the Cares Act stimulus package more than offset lost
earnings for many low-wage earners. This helped lower the nation’s
poverty rate in April and May, when it was projected to spike after the
pandemic set off widespread job losses.</p>

<p>“We were sufficiently aggressive in responding to the pandemic early,”
Meyer said. “But if we can’t sort things out soon, there’s going to be
a lot of people who are hurting.”</p>

<p>Code of Vets is used to requests for help with funeral expenses,
hospital bills and housing issues. Since the pandemic, the nonprofit
says, it has been inundated by veterans who can’t meet their basic
needs: groceries, medications, utility bills. Diapers are a chronic
concern for those with young children.</p>

<p>In January, a typical month pre-pandemic, it handled 86 cases, said
Gretchen Smith, who founded the nonprofit in 2018 to honor her father,
a Vietnam veteran who struggled with PTSD. In April, after more than 20
million Americans lost their jobs in the coronavirus recession, Code of
Vets had more than 1,300 cases. The scale of need has been consistent,
Smith said, even with the federal stimulus.</p>

<p>Last week, Smith said, one desperate mother admitted she had resorted
to stealing to feed her 5-year-old boy.</p>

<p>“What do we do at this point?” Smith said. “They’re living on air.”</p>

<p>Struggling people are raising rent money on GoFundMe and asking for
help with groceries on Facebook Marketplace. In <a href="https://www.nola.com/multimedia/photos/collection_20c3ed8c-d288-11ea-85cf-2b21a79e5ab9.html#anchor_item_2">New Orleans</a>,
some have staged sit-ins in front of courthouses to block eviction
hearings, with signs urging the local government to cancel rent: “You
can’t wash your hands if you don’t have a sink.”</p>

<p>Karin Smith, 52, of Jupiter, Fla., recently opened the two-bedroom
townhouse she shares with her 13-year-old son to a fellow single mom
with a daughter. They’re all facing eviction, much like the 22 million
other Americans behind on their rent, according to an analysis by the
Covid-19 Eviction Defense Project, a Colorado-based community group.
Despite the federal moratorium that ended July 24, some landlords are
raising rent, issuing late fees and initiating eviction proceedings
earlier than the federal deadline, which requires 30 days notice for
eviction.</p>

<p>Black and Latino renters are the most at risk: In July, 44 percent and
41 percent, respectively, said they had no or slight confidence they
could make the next month’s payment or were likely to defer it,
according to a U.S. Census Bureau survey. About 21 percent of White
renters felt the same, according to an Urban Institute <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.urban.org_features_tracking-2Dcovid-2D19s-2Deffects-2Drace-2Dand-2Dethnicity&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&amp;r=PJrjwvIziEVYRkm3J_u_HTXovjspJge9b1eqlKO7HgI&amp;m=BjpTo-yGLAJQjj1eWv8PQX2nTFVutZ0WzEDbq5kP67A&amp;s=N6GudD6tsdwJP95hcFja3jxoXa-T_q9-nhbShuKMgmU&amp;e=">analysis</a>
of the data collected between May 28 and June 9.</p>

<p>Karin couldn’t stand the idea of a family being pushed out into the
streets.</p>

<p>“It’s like people are just standing around watching it,” she said.
“This time of year, we shouldn’t be able to be evicted with storms. You
can’t have homeless people during hurricane season or a pandemic.”</p>

<p>Karin lost her job as a U.S. Department of Education contractor on
March 14 and told her landlord right away that the $1,650 rent would be
a struggle. The landlord initially agreed to a payment schedule, she
said, then on April 2 told Karin she would be evicted if she was even a
day late.</p>

<p>Since then, Karin and her son, who has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which
affects connective tissue, have been living on food stamps and
unemployment benefits that did not arrive until May. The state jobless
aid started at $125 a week and was recently bumped to $225. She was
earning $96,000 a year, but as a single mom with tens of thousands in
student loans, health insurance premiums and other expenses, she didn’t
have a lot of savings.</p>

<p>“Things were so behind at the end of May, as soon as it was coming in,
it was going out,” she said. “With the $600 [weekly unemployment
benefits], I could cover the necessities. I’m not sure what I can cover
with [$225].”</p>

<p>Although Karin has a PhD in educational psychology, she hasn’t been
able to find a job in her field, and a minimum wage position wouldn’t
cover the rent. When Sept. 1 rolls around, she doesn’t know what the
four of them — plus two cats and two dogs, most taken in from others
who had been evicted — will do. Her son has been urging her to start
selling household items to save up for a used mobile home. Karin said
he’s been pressing her ever since he read that Walmart allows RVs to
park in its lots for free.</p>

<p>“Now I know why my great-grandmother never wanted to talk about the
Spanish flu,” she said. “When this is over, none of us will want to
talk about it.”</p>

<p>Diane Yentel, the president and chief executive of the National Low
Income Housing Coalition, said the 40 million U.S. households projected
for eviction by year’s end — and the lack of legislative action to
prevent them — is nothing she’s ever seen.</p>

<p>The coalition is lobbying for a national eviction moratorium through
the end of the pandemic and $100 billion in emergency assistance to
supplement rent payments and help landlords operate properties. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/05/15/democrats-pelosi-congress-coronavirus-3-trillion-trump/?itid=lk_inline_manual_43">Heroes
Act</a>
included these two programs but stalled out in the Senate.</p>

<p>Before the coronavirus, homelessness had steadily increased for the
past three years, as only 1 in 4 eligible households received help. Now
more people are living on the streets, in their cars, crowding into
apartments, and living in shelters or encampments, Yentel said. Social
distancing, a key defense against the coronavirus, is impossible.</p>

<p>“When our collective health depends on our ability to stay in our
homes, we all have a stake to ensure that tens of millions of people
don’t lose theirs,” Yentel said. “Evictions during a pandemic are not
only cruel and immoral, they are shortsighted and senseless.”</p>

<p>Laura Thayer said her mind went blank when she got up to cross-examine
her landlord. She said she had been in and out of court the past two
months after her landlord denied her payment plan and lease renewal,
and applied her past rent payment to another tenant and charged her
late fees. The 50-year-old had experienced anxiety attacks before, but
fighting to keep a roof over her and her partner’s heads in a
Springfield, Mo., multifamily apartment was a new kind of panic.</p>

<p>“The cards are stacked from the beginning, and to be honest, I can’t
believe I’ve made it this far,” Thayer said. “I realize this could be
one of the last few days in my place, or it could be the first of
many.”</p>

<p>Every day when she gets home, Thayer braces for the knock on her door.
If she doesn’t win this case, she doesn’t know where she and her
partner will live — especially because landlords often see eviction
records and charge double deposits and extra fees.</p>

<p>Thayer fell behind on the rent after losing her job in December, after
taking time off to care for her partner, who has health issues and
recently applied for Social Security benefits. She didn’t qualify for
unemployment insurance until June. She receives federal aid to cover
utilities, but her EBT card didn’t qualify for renewal because she had
too much in her savings account: $2,200.</p>

<p>Hunger has hovered near record highs since the beginning of the
pandemic, as shuttered school meal programs and vanishing income left
many without a way to feed their families. About 22 percent of the
population has been food-insecure since the pandemic began, according
to an April report by the Hamilton Project, an economic policy project
of the Brookings Institution. For mothers with children 12 and younger,
the figure is more than 40 percent, according to Lauren Bauer, who
wrote the report.</p>

<p>“This is not just affecting families who suffered some sort of income
shock,” Bauer said. “This is really penetrating families with low-wage
and essential workers.”</p>

<p>Increased flexibility in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,
which provides food stamps, helped fuel an unprecedented spike in SNAP
enrollment, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
From March through April, 6 million people became newly eligible for
SNAP. But the Trump administration recently decided against extending a
food stamps waiver that allowed needy families to bypass certification,
such as providing pay stubs. The move will reduce the number of
eligible families in the coming months, even as other stimulus measures
expire.</p>

<p>Food banks nationwide have struggled to keep up with demand, and
surging grocery prices are compounding the strain, said Crystal
FitzSimons, the director of school and out-of-school time programs at
the Food Research &amp; Action Center.</p>

<p>“When families are on limited and stretched budgets, or when they’ve
lost wages to lost jobs or reduced hours of work and then food prices
go up, their dollars don’t go as far,” FitzSimons said. “Low-income
families work really hard to stretch dollars as far as possible, but
with the cost of food is going up it really makes it hard for families
to afford the diet that they need.”</p>

<p>Suzanne St. John, 69, of Clearwater, Fla., hasn’t had more than $25 in
her savings account for as long as she can remember. The retired
English teacher has to stretch her $870 in monthly Social Security
benefits to support herself and her granddaughter, who moved in after
losing her job in March. She depends on food stamps, which she uses to
pay for grocery delivery since she’s high risk for the coronavirus and
doesn’t own a car. But each month she worries her latest SNAP card will
be the last.</p>

<p>“If it weren’t for that, I don’t know what I would be eating,” St. John
said.</p>

<p>Nonprofits and community organizations have stepped in to fill the gaps
in many states. When the pandemic shuttered Boston Public Schools in
mid-March, the YMCA of Greater Boston shuttered its aquatics and
wellness programs, and funneled its resources into local food programs,
chief executive James Morton said.</p>

<p>In 2019, the Boston organization delivered 837,000 meals. From March 16
to Aug. 7, it delivered more than 2 million meals and 91,000 bags of
groceries. Morton said the YMCA is determined to help families meet
their basic needs — food, shelter, child care.</p>

<p>“Let’s feed our children, let’s house our families, let’s make sure
everybody’s got a decent job — those are not unique strategies, those
are essential strategies,” Morton said. “I think we’re losing sight of
that a little bit.”</p>

<p>Lea, 24, of Marietta, Ga., woke up July 27 to find a note on her door
from the sheriff. She had 30 days to come up with $2,278 or get out.</p>

<p>Lea, who declined to share her last name out of fear of retaliation
from her landlord, was living paycheck to paycheck even before the
pandemic. Now she’s barely afloat. She lost her job, but her employer
had a noncompete clause and she wasn’t eligible for unemployment. Then
her laptop broke and her car got towed. She’s worked every kind of gig:
babysitting, tutoring, cleaning cars and apartments. She got a loan
from her mom. But it wasn’t enough.</p>

<p>“I did everything I could to scrape money together,” she said. “No
matter what I was doing, I kept falling behind. No matter how hard I
tried, there was another bill and another bill.”</p>

<p>Desperate, she launched a GoFundMe campaign and hoped the kindness of
strangers could save her from eviction. Donations came flooding in, and
she was able to raise enough to pay off her late bills and fees from
her landlord — at least for August.</p>

<p>But next month, she doesn’t know where she’ll get the money for rent,
utilities or groceries. She’s trying to sell her TV and looking into
local women’s shelters.</p>

<p>“I’d love to be more optimistic about what’s going to happen in the
future,” she said. “But I just don’t see it.”</p>
