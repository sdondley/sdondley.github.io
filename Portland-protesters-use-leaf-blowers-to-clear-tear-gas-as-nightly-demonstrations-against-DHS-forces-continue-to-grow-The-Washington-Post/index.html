<p>Leaf-blower wars: How Portland protesters are fighting back against tear gas and forming ‘walls’ of veterans, lawyers, nurses</p>

<p>PORTLAND, Ore. — The tear gas started early Friday night, interrupting a
line of drums and dancing, chanting protesters, an artist painting in oils
underneath a tree in the park and a man with a microphone speaking about
the issues of racial justice and policing at the center of these nightly
demonstrations.</p>

<p>“Hey guys, don’t panic, don’t panic,” the man said from the steps of the
Multnomah County Justice Center, one block over from the federal courthouse
in downtown Portland. “All you first-timers out here, it’s just tear gas.
Everybody just relax.”</p>

<p>As if on cue, a brigade of orange-shirted men with leaf blowers descended
on the cloud, revved their engines and blew the tear gas away. The crowd
cheered.</p>

<p>“Thank you leaf-blower dads!” shouted a young woman.</p>

<p>Every night for more than a week, federal agents have been unleashing a
barrage of tear gas on crowds of demonstrators, a small number of whom have
lobbed fireworks at the federal courthouse, set fires and tried to tear
down a tall, reinforced metal fence surrounding the building. The noxious
fog burns and stings. Some people who get hit with the dense plumes of
chemicals that cloud Portland’s streets each night feel like they can’t
breathe, like their eyes are on fire, like they might vomit onto the
asphalt.</p>

<p>Though some Portlanders have been able to get respirators, goggles and gas
masks to protect themselves from the worst effects of the riot control
agent known as CS gas, many others have turned to a familiar landscaping
tool to blow the chemicals away: leaf blowers.</p>

<p>The loud, pressurized air machines typically used to clear grass, leaves
and other lawn debris are surprisingly effective tools at clearing caustic
chemicals from the air. They’re so effective that on Friday night, federal
agents frustrated at being caught in up in a redirected cloud of tear gas,
showed up to the demonstration with their own handheld blowers.</p>

<p>The leaf-blower wars were on.</p>

<p>“I’m totally impressed with all the courage we’re seeing from just normal
people who have taken it on themselves to come out here and stand up for
our right to protest,” said Eddie, a 35-year-old Portlander who declined to
give his last name out of fear of retaliation from federal officers.</p>

<p>Eddie, who wore a gas mask and leather jacket for protection from
projectiles, said although he’s not a dad, he was inspired by the formation
of the “Leaf blower dads group” to bring a blower to the demonstrations. He
even fashioned a leather strap out of a belt so he could sling it over his
shoulder and carry it around all night.</p>

<p>“You’ve got the moms out here on the front line and the dads backing them
up with the leaf blowers,” he said. “It’s pretty amazing.”</p>

<p>CS gas, or 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile, has been classified as a chemical
weapon. Its use is banned on the battlefield by nearly every country in the
world, including the United States. But it is legal to use domestically by
police and federal agents to disperse crowds.</p>

<p>Typically, police fire the agent once or twice to clear crowds and
encourage people to move away from an area, said Michelle Heisler, the
medical director of Physicians for Human Rights. But in Portland, federal
agents have been unleashing the chemicals repeatedly for hours. This
sustained cascade makes it difficult for peaceful demonstrators to avoid
being hit and runs the risk of ensnaring bystanders in the area, she said.</p>

<p>“The people here are not dispersing, so these federal officials are just
launching massive amounts of it,” Heisler said. “It can blind people. It
can kill people through chemical burns — especially people who have asthma
or other lung diseases. This is dangerous stuff.”</p>

<p>Enter the leaf blowers.</p>

<p>A group of self-identified Portland dads, inspired by the “Wall of Moms”
that forms a protective human shield at the front of nightly protests near
the Mark O. Hatfield Courthouse, set out to help clear the air at protests
by arming themselves with leaf blowers. They are known collectively as
“DadBloc” and “Leaf-Blower Dads” and turn up to the protests wearing orange
shirts to compliment the moms’ yellow ones.</p>

<p>Each night, their numbers have swelled.</p>

<p>On Friday, they were joined by other burgeoning groups — the veteran-led
Wall of Vets, green-shirted Teachers Against Tyrants, the pizza-box
carrying ChefBloc, health-care workers in scrubs and Lawyers for Black
Lives, who turned up at the protest in suits and ties.</p>

<p>Tessa Terry, 30, and her husband, Leshan Terry, 31, are Navy veterans who
helped organize the Portland “Wall of Vets” after seeing a video of federal
agents beating a Navy veteran with batons so badly they broke his hand. On
Friday night, they attended their first demonstration since President Trump
sent dozens of federal law enforcement officers to Portland — a move that
Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler (D), who was tear-gassed with the crowd earlier
this week, and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) have likened to a hostile
occupation.</p>

<p>Though the Terrys had been through military training that puts recruits in
a gas chamber, where they have to take off their masks and breathe in the
fumes, Tessa Terry said, the chemicals in the air on Friday were
overwhelming.</p>

<p>“They’re not just doing one or two — or even three or four — in a night,”
Tessa Terry said. “They’re popping them off the entire night, and I’ve
never seen anything like that.”</p>

<p>Canisters found strewn about downtown streets indicate some of the gas may
be expired, which experts said could make the chemicals feel more potent.</p>

<p>Human rights groups and health professionals have cautioned that tear gas
could help spread the still-raging coronavirus because it irritates the
lungs, makes people cough and causes a sensation that many react to by
ripping off cloth masks they may be wearing to help mitigate the spread of
the disease.</p>

<p>On their second night, the Terrys will be more prepared, they said. Leshan
Terry, a former aviation mechanic, will be bringing his own blower.</p>

<p>Part of the reason the blowers are so effective against tear gas, experts
said, is because despite the name, the chemicals in the canisters are
actually an aerosol rather than a typical gas. That means tiny powder-like
particles are dispersed into the air, where they hang and drift like a
menacing fog.</p>

<p>Should a person be hit by the chemical substance, the particles stick to
their body, clothes and any other surface they come into contact with, said
Lewis Nelson, a Rutgers New Jersey Medical School professor who also works
at the New Jersey Poison Center.</p>

<p>When the leaf blowers turn their blast of air on the chemical cloud, Nelson
said, it sends the cloud in another direction. If the protesters push the
tear gas back toward federal agents, the particles could latch onto their
uniforms, helmets and other gear.</p>

<p>It makes sense then, Heisler said, that the agents would muster their own
arsenal of blowers.</p>

<p>It was not clear where all these leaf blowers were coming from. They range
in size and firepower. One man on a recent night held a tiny handheld
blower above his head as a cloud of gas crept closer. The blower was about
one foot from end to end. On Friday, several men carried large blowers
powered by fuel packs strapped to their backs.</p>

<p>Hardware stores in the Portland area said they hadn’t noticed a rush on
leaf-blowers in recent weeks, but several managers noted that summer is
typically a hot season for leaf-blower sales.</p>

<p>Just after midnight Saturday, a gas canister landed on the south side of
the federal courthouse, just past a large banner that protesters had hung
on the reinforced black fence around the courthouse with the letters BLM,
an abbreviation for Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>“Throw it back!” yelled the crowd. “Get rid of it!”</p>

<p>A man with a leaf blower strapped to his back snuffed out a lit cigarette
and sighed.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said to himself. “Time to get gassed again.”</p>

<p>He revved up the machine, adjusted its straps and marched forward into the
gathering fog.</p>
