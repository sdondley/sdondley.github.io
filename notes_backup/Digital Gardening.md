title: 'Thoughts on Digital Gardening'


There's apparently a new trend happening right now called "Digital Gardening." I
won't bore you with a definition of what it is. Other people have already done a
good job of explaining it so I'll let you [google
it.](https://www.google.com/search?q=digital+gardening)

Anyway, I guess this new website I put up qualifies as a "digital garden."

I've always had an interest in maintaing a personal website. I've started and
abandoned quite a few. They were just too much of a hassle to upkeep and
maintain. Then along came social media and the barrier to putting yourself out
there was so low, just about everyone flocked to those outlets to express
themselves instead of building a personal website.

## Everything old is new again

But the "digital [garden](/garden)" phenomena is a movement back toward having a
full-blown website. Why? I have a few ideas:

* **It helps you stand out.** Any schmo can get a Twitter or Facebook account. But
  not everyone has their own website, which still carries some cachet.
* **You can be more creative.** Communication is expression. Experssion is
  art. Art demands you express yourself creatively. And you can be much more
  creative when you run your own website and set your own rules.
* **It helps you connect with other like-minded people.** We all long to belong.
  Sharing ideas with other interesting people helps us connect with
  them and we learn a lot.
* **It's becoming much less frictionless for the technically savvy.** Yes, it
  took quite a bit of work to get set up and figure out a workflow that suits
  me, but now I've got a great solution in place that lets me use my vim text
  editor and a few plugins. Coupled with Jekyll and Github Pages, I've got a
  fantastic solution that allows me focus much more on writing and much less on
  the very tedious and time-consuming job of maintaining a website with a
  traditional content management system and wrangling with it to get it to do
  what I want.
* **People are sick of social media.** Social media has become a cesspool. The
  loudest, dumbest, most obnoxious voices dominate the conversation. Setting up
  a digital garden allows you to communicate without participating in a toxic
  environment. It's like your own little peaceful park in the middle of the busy
  city that other can visit and come listen to you.
